Source paper title: *Benchmark Problems for Robust Control Design*

Source paper authors: Wie, Bernstein

### Binary distillation column
ID 0000009001

Source paper title: *Benchmark Problems for Control System Design*

Source paper authors: Davison

Notes: This problem describes a fairly realistic model of a binary distillation column,
and has the feature that pressure variation is included in the model's description;
the system is multivariable, with 3 inputs and 3 outputs, and includes one disturbance input.
The system A matrix has an almost banded diagonal structure with 11 states,
3 of which are directly measured as output.

### Drum boiler
ID 0000009002

Source paper title: *Benchmark Problems for Control System Design*

Source paper authors: Davison

Notes: This problem describes a fairly realistic model of a drum boiler
and has the feature of being multivariable, unstable, and non-minimum phase.
Problem has a variation where the third input is not used.

### Cold rolling mill
ID 5000009004

Source paper title: *Benchmark Problems for Control System Design*
