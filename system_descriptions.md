### Binary distillation column
ID 0000009001

Source title: *Benchmark Problems for Control System Design*

Source authors: Davison

Source URL: [https://taskforce.ifac-control.org/industry-committee/reference-materials/benchmark-problems-for-control-system-design/view](https://taskforce.ifac-control.org/industry-committee/reference-materials/benchmark-problems-for-control-system-design/view)

Notes: This problem describes a fairly realistic model of a binary distillation column,
and has the feature that pressure variation is included in the model's description;
the system is multivariable, with 3 inputs and 3 outputs, and includes one disturbance input.
The system A matrix has an almost banded diagonal structure with 11 states,
3 of which are directly measured as output.

### Drum boiler

Notes: This problem describes a fairly realistic model of a drum boiler
and has the feature of being multivariable, unstable, and non-minimum phase.
Problem has a variation where the third input is not used.

Notes: This problem deals with a two-stand cold rolling mill.
The process dynamics are dominated by the interstand time delay.
A discrete 10th order model is given.
The model includes disturbances, is multivariable and strongly interacting.
